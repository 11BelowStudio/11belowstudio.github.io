          I provide weekly drop-in support sessions at my local library,

          This ranges from simple tasks
          (such as scanning/printing documents or browsing the internet) to
          some more complex tasks (such as navigating kafkaesque online bureaucracy,
          or recovering logins to seldom-used emails).<br/>
          I aim to empower people by enhancing their digital skills, and improving their confidence with technology.

        <h3>I ❤️ Games</h3>
        <div>
          I have always enjoyed playing games (and have spent a pretty large amount of time playing them).<br/>
          Currently, I'd say my favourite games are <cite>GTFO</cite> and <cite>Deep Rock Galactic</cite> -
          I could go into an excessive amount of detail about which games I enjoy playing, but I'll spare you the infodump.<br/>
          I've also dabbled in creating custom maps for <cite>Counter-Strike</cite>, making mods for <cite>Payday 2</cite>,
          making charts for <cite>Trombone Champ</cite>, and contributing to several videogame wikis.
        </div>

        <h3>I 🧡 Games as an art form</h3>
        <div>
          Yes, I know, <i>toootally</i> controversial take, but I consider games as an art form,
          and I have a passion for designing and creating games as works of art.<br/>
          I find having a clear artistic vision for a game helps to guide the design and implementation
          process of it - and ultimately leads to a much better, more cohesive, end result.
        </div>

        <h3>I 💛 Solving problems</h3>
        <div>
          I'm the sort of person who, upon noticing something that's not quite right,
          will attempt to do something about it, rather than just letting it fester. ADHD brain go whee.<br/>
          Most of my contributions to Wikipedia (and other videogame wikis) have been motivated by this,
          along with most of the pull requests I've submitted to various public repos on github.<br/>
          I find the end result of solving these problems to be rather satisfying.

        <h3>I 💚 Theme Parks</h3>
        <div>
          Does this have anything to do with getting into the games industry? Good question!<br/>
          However, I've always been a fan of theme parks, visiting them, and researching how they
          work behind the curtain to deliver the 'magic' that they do.<br/>
          Chalk it up to being an autistic kid growing up somewhat near a couple of theme parks, I guess.<br/>
          However, it has been a bit of an inspiration in my endeavours towards delivering interesting experiences
          through my games.
