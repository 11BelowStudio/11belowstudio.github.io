      <strong>Committy!</strong> is a live service travesty of a card game,
      produced for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/sbigjam2023" target="_blank"><em>'So Bad It's Good' Jam 2023</em></a>.
      <br/>The theme for the jam this year was <cite>Every Suggestion Combined</cite>,
      so I decided to take the theme in a completely tangental direction,
      by creating a simple card game intended to be the <i>sum of everyone's suggestions</i> in card game form.
      In other words - every single card is a user contribution, and the interactions between them are determined via precedent.

      <strong>Committy!</strong> had a mildly eventful development cycle. Due to family reasons (omitted here),
      I knew that I wouldn't have as much time to work on the game as I would have wanted, so I had to keep the scope
      somewhat restrained (leading to the tangental interpretation of <cite>Every Suggestion Combined</cite>,
      in the form of a game which would appear to have been 'designed by committee' - hence the name).
      <br/>The core ideas of 'user-created cards', 'players must select the objectively superior card',
      and 'a third party must be the ultimate arbitrator of what qualifies as "objectively superior"'
      came rather quickly afterwards.
      <br/>I initially considered trying to make this game as a purely physical game
      - mostly motivated by time constraints, but also due to the potential physical comedy of an ever-increasing
      physical deck of cards one would have to keep using and adding to - but practicality
      (and the greater potential comedy from having one deck that everyone contributes to) led to the present implementation.
