    <div class="paragraph">
      As stated above, this game wasn't entirely made by myself - however, due to a lack of programmers on the team, I was responsible for almost all
      of the actual implementation of this game (whilst the other team members handled most of the asset creation).<br/>
      The design of the game came about as a combination of various suggestions from the team for game ideas.
      One member of the team suggested 'making something laugh by tickling it', followed by another person suggesting the use of a feather,
      at which point my brain jumped to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Feathersword" target="_blank"><i>Captain Feathersword</i> from <cite>The Wiggles</cite></a>,
      and so I pitched the idea of this game - and we ultimately chose to work on this concept.
      The ragdoll physics were included as a result of another team member suggesting 'clumsiness' in the prior conversation.
      <span class="reveal">More info <span class="opposite-hide">(hover)</span><br/>
      <span class="hide">Initially, I concieved this game as some Totally Real Lost Media from <cite>The Wiggles</cite>,
      in which Captain Feathersword (from <cite>The Wiggles</cite>) would be lootin' treasure from some scallywags in t' seven seas,
      wit' all t' violence needed to defeat those scurvy dogs - but presented in a "family friendly" way via overzealous whitewashing
      of the violence (you <em>TICKLE</em> your <em>FRIENDS</em> with your <em>FEATHERSWORD</em> to make them fall to the ground in <em>UNCONTROLLABLE LAUGHTER</em>)
      - with the meta-narrative of the game being that it became lost media due to The Wiggles promptly forcing development to cease as soon as they found out about the violence in the game.
      This proposal ended up on the cutting room floor, but it may or may not still be part of the meta-narrative of the finished product ðŸ™ƒ.</span></span>
    </div>

    
    <div class="paragraph">
      <cite>Feathersword's Revenge</cite> is a single-player wave survival sort of game - in which waves of enemy pirates spawn in to <em>TICKLE</em> you,
      (with the enemy count and AI parameters getting higher with each wave), and you must <em>TICKLE</em> all of them
      (making them fall <em>LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY</em>) before they can do the same to you - and see how many waves you can survive.
      This differed from the original plan of 'looting treasure from enemy pirates' mostly due to the time constraints of the game jam making
      a level-based structure to the game rather unfeasible to fully design and implement, but 'surviving endless waves of AI enemies' was
      - but it still was a challenge to get the game implemented.
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
      Due to our team all working remotely, being complete strangers, and not all knowing how to use various collaboration/creation tools,
      there were some aspects of the development process which could have gone better. For example, whilst I opted to jump straight in with
      creating a git repository, making the Unity project, and implementing the prototype after we agreed on the concept
      (as I had been designated as the de facto implementation person, being the sole programmer on the team), we didn't get around to
      planning what everyone else would be doing, which delayed the asset creation process due to people not knowing what assets they needed to make,
      and caused some other delays later on in development due to the eternal problem of 'not knowing if someone else was already doing the thing'.
      One victim of this was the custom player model which one team member managed to create, based on some concept art produced by another team member -
      unfortunately, due to extreme time constraints, we weren't able to fully sort out the rigging on it and use it as the player model,
      rendering it completely unused within the finished product. Additionally, most of the people in the team were unfamiliar with version control
      systems, so several assets had to be sent via discord (and downloaded/added to the project manually) whilst doing it all via a VCS system would have
      streamlined the process somewhat.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      Still, nitpicks aside, I still think that <cite>Feathersword's Revenge</cite> was a success. The game has a full gameplay loop,
      it functions mostly as intended, fits the theme of the game jam (the game is about making people laugh), and it's rather fun,
      with some great audio (produced by the rest of the team) as well. Not bad for 48 hours!

      <br/>The theme for the jam this year was <cite>Every Suggestion Combined</cite>,

      In other words - every single card is a user contribution, and the interactions between them are determined via precedent,
      whilst going for an overall feeling of being 'designed by committee' (hence the name).

      <cite>Committy</cite> had a mildly eventful development cycle. Due to family reasons (omitted here),
      I knew that I wouldn't have as much time to work on the game as I would have wanted, so I had to keep the scope
      somewhat restrained (leading to the tangental interpretation of <cite>Every Suggestion Combined</cite>,
      in the form of a game which would appear to have been 'designed by committee' - hence the name).
      <br/>The core ideas of 'user-created cards', 'players must select the objectively superior card',
      and 'a third party must be the ultimate arbitrator of what qualifies as "objectively superior"'
      came rather quickly afterwards.
      <br/>I initially considered trying to make this game as a purely physical card game
      - mostly motivated by time constraints, but also due to the potential physical comedy of an ever-increasing
      physical deck of cards one would have to keep using and adding to - but practicality
      (and the greater potential comedy from having one deck that everyone contributes to) led to the present implementation.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      Overall, I'm rather unsatisfied with the final state of <cite>Committy</cite>.
      Several planned features (such as online multiplayer) ended up on the cutting room floor (time constraints),
      the intended feeling of being 'designed by committee' was not fully realized,
      and the overall concept was rather mediocre overall.
      Sure, it was my first ever attempt at using Node.js, and it did have a <i>very</i> rushed development cycle,
      so it could have gone worse - but it could have gone much better.

      This project was a continuation of an existing partnership between Natural England and the University of Essex regarding ongoing
      conservation efforts in the <a href="https://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/4884193307000832" target="_blank">Cromer Shoal MCZ</a>,
      and as part of that work, some photogrammetry models of the Cromer Shoal sea floor were produced. Then, in late 2021 (during my MSc),
      one of the possible dissertation projects was to create a game (using said models) which can be used to evaluate the impacts of environment complexity
      on marine wildlife - which sounded interesting and doable
      (given my prior <a href="https://11belowstudio.itch.io/inconvenient-space-rocks-2" target="_blank">dabbling into multiplayer development</a>) - 
      which lead to this game being made (simulating the local wildlife in their native habitat).
      <br/>
      <cite>CrabFight</cite> is a fully-functional multiplayer game, and is capable of recording data from gameplay sessions about where players were going,
      the current status of their crabs, what the crabs were doing, etc. within json files (without storing any personal data, for GDPR compliance),
      however, during the timeframe of the MSc thesis project, I didn't have an opportunity to proceed to the 'data analysis' phase.
      In spite of this, the stakeholders were still very pleased with the game (for use as a game),
      hence why they employed me to enhance it for them
      for use at public events, as a means of driving public interest in their wider conservation efforts.<br/>
      They have also been provided with handover documentation, to allow them to run the game at events themselves,
      and I still remain in contact with them for post-launch updates in response to visitor feedback from these events.

      The high-level gameplay structure of <cite>CrabFind</cite> was somewhat inspired by that of <cite>Jackbox</cite>/<cite>Kahoot</cite>,
      using prompts shown to all players on a host machine to guide gameplay on client machines.
      At an abstract level, players are given three clues (one at a time), displayed on the screen of the host PC,
      and need to find the appropriate artefact (from the HMS Racehorse) in the wreckage. The fewer clues it took for one to find the answer,
      the more points one is awarded upon reaching the answer (with a bonus point for finding it first).
      After time runs out, the answer is shown to all players (followed by the updated scoreboard).
      This repeats for a few rounds, and whichever player has the most points at the end wins.

      I had to use for the gameplay weren't entirely ideal for creating a game (especially a mobile-playable game) -
      which lead to me learning how to use Blender in order to fill in the holes, optimize the meshes,
      and make them more traversable without completely mangling the meshes beyond all recognition.<br/>
      For the artefacts - I was granted permission to use the
      <a href="https://www.imuseum.im/hms-racehorse/" target="_blank">Isle of Man Museum collection</a> - however,
      these are all 2D photographs. In order to make them work in the 3D environments,
      I opted to improvise by using billboarding - which also helped to make them stand out in the environments.<br/>
      Finally, the overarching development cycle - Whilst I did have <cite>CrabFight</cite>
      as a basis (meaning that I didn't need to rewrite the whole main menu and backend-y multiplayer management components),
      I still had a very limited amount of time in which to design the game (whilst ensuring that the stakeholders
      approved of the design), sort out the assets, and develop the game (and dealing with some family issues which arose during this time).

      I had two main design goals in mind for this game. The first was to make the player panic. The second was to make the experience feel
      amusingly scuffed (befitting the <i>So Bad It's Good</i> nature of the game jam).
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
      The core power/"asleepn'tness" systems of <cite>Kevin's</cite> were heavily inspired by the power/exposure systems of
      <cite>One Night At Flumpty's 2</cite> (instead of the traditional 'fixed amount of power, instant loss when enemy arrives' system
      used in most FNAF-style games). This lose condition felt more in line with the game scenario (not waking up Kevin's pet tortoise),
      and the recharging camera power was easier to balance, whilst demanding near-constant player attention.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      The first thing I designed was actually the layout of the building - in the shape of a very crudely-drawn tortoise - for the latter design goal.
      I then started thinking about possible routes which enemies could take through the building to the player - culminating in the behaviours of the four main enemies
      (all but one of which being incredibly contrived 'tortoises', for lore reasons).
      Each of the enemies have different paths to the player's location (one takes the same route every time, one has a route that gradually shortens,
      one takes a randomly-selected route, and one has a very short route but can be moved back if stared at enough), and fill up "asleepn'tness" at differing rates,
      requiring the player to prioritize which threats to respond to.<br/>
      Of course, the player could opt to just leave the door to the office closed all the time, and remain safe - which is why there are two mechanics to prevent this.
      The first one is in the form of a recurring character from my previous <i>So Bad It's Good Jam</i> entries, whom decided to be "helpful" by providing
      an auto-playing CD player full of utterly horrible tortoise lullabies, forcing the player to turn around and mute it regularly (leaving the door ajar) before it can disturb the tortoise.
      The second was added later on - in the form of sÌ·Ì¾Ì¯oÌ·Í‹ÍšmÌ´Ì¿Í‰eÌµÌ¾Ì§tÌ·Ì›Í‡hÌ¸Ì¾Ì¡iÌ¸Í†Ì¢nÌ´Ì“Ì¹gÌ¸Í›Ì§ utterly unnatural, whom only moves whilst the door is held closed, and tends to aggravate the other tortoises
      (and makes the CD player unmute itself faster) whenever it moves - leading to Consequences for those whom try to cower behind the door all the time.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      One flaw with the game is that the comedic value of it is mostly derived from the absurd situation the player finds themselves in - which, once the player
      gets over it, immediately becomes mundane. As a game jam game, this arguably isn't a massive problem, but it does severely hinder replayability.

      Is <em>CRAPPY</em> a physics engine which one should seriously consider using? To be completely honest - probably not.
      However, creating <em>CRAPPY</em> (along with this game) has helped me to gain a greater understanding of the
      theory and practice behind how physics engines work - along with some practical understanding of some of the mistakes to avoid when making them.
